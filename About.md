### What I learned

- this project is scale my level i feel it in starting 
- designed toggle button and overall header is tricky but did it

- i forgote when i chnage from div to span. span is inline elements and then i search stackoverflow then applied display block 

- i designed Answer div its easy but there is one problem answer overflow 

- the the main part is button counter it take time bcz always i use flex but i learn new about properties grid its amazing and then i developed its take lots of time 

- and then use color picker and pic color from images and change all properties color bcz challenger does't provide same value
